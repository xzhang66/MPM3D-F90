## About
**MPM3D-F90** is the simplified FORTRAN 90 version of [MPM3D](http://comdyn.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/english/mpm3d), and servers as the companion open source code for our MPM books: 

1. X Zhang, Z Chen, Y Liu. [**The Material Point Method** - A Continuum-Based Particle Method for Extreme Loading Cases](http://store.elsevier.com/The-Material-Point-Method/Xiong-Zhang/isbn-9780124077164/). Academic Press, 2016; 

2. X Zhang, YP Lian, Y Liu, X Zhou. [Material Point Method (in Chinese)](http://comdyn.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/downloads/mpm-book), Beijing: Tsinghua University Press, 2013. 

Please refer to these two books for detailed explanation about its source codes and usage.

The MPM3D-F90 can be obtained from GitHub at **https://github.com/xzhang66/MPM3D-F90**. You are welcome to share your improvements and enhancements to MPM3D-F90, or share your input data files and simulation results. Please send you feedback to me at [xzhang@tsinghua.edu.cn](mailto:xzhang@tsinghua.edu.cn).

Please cite our books and related publications in your publication if MPM3D-F90 or MPM3D is used in your work. Here is the **[List of our publications in Material Point Method](http://comdyn.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/english/mpm3d?view=article&id=553).**

## Source code organization
The code is organized as:

**src**:  Souce files (MPM3D.f90, Particle.f90, DataIn.f90, DataOut.f90, FFI.f90, Grid.f90, Material.f90, update_step.f90, Constitution.f90)

**CMakeLists.txt**: Used to generate standard build files (e.g., makefiles on Unix and projects/workspaces in Windows MSVC) by [CMake](https://cmake.org/overview/)

**make**: Predefined build files for GNU and Intel Visual Fortran compiler. The build files for other compliers can be generated by using  [CMake](https://cmake.org/overview/) from CMakeLists.txt file.

> **gnu**:  make file for GNU Fortran compiler

> **ivf**:  solution file for Intel Visual Fortran compiler

**Data**:  Example input data

> **Deto1k.mpm**:  1D slab TNT detonation

> **Taylor.mpm**:  Taylor bar impact

> **PeneOgive.mpm**:  Penetration of a ogive projectile

> **Slopefail.mpm**:  Failure of slope

**VolumetricLockingEx**:  Example input data used to verify SGMPM's ability to free volumetric locking


## Compile and baisc usage

Under **Linux**, you can compile and run an example by the following code:
```sh
cd MPM3D-F90
cmake .
make
./mpm3d Data/Deto1k.mpm
```

In **Windows**, you can install cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com/) and after adding cygwin64/bin to the path, you can compile the program as:
```sh
cd .\make\gnu\
make clean
make
.\mpm3d Data/Deto1k.mpm
```
