1. Add a stress smoothing processing module based on grid mapping, activate by entering the keyword 'smoo'.
2. Add a module for handling fixed or symmetric boundaries in SGMPM, and activate the SGMPM solver by entering the keyword 'sgmp'. When solving the problem with only free boundaries, extending the background mesh so that the auxiliary mesh covers the discrete domain of material points is sufficient.
But when solving the problem with symmetric or fixed boundary conditions, it is necessary to extend a layer of background mesh outward at that boundary, and only one layer of background mesh can be extended.
For plane problems, two symmetrical boundary conditions are set in the direction perpendicular to the plane, and there is no need to expand the background grid in that direction. A layer of background grid can be set in that vertical direction.
3. Add a total Lagrangian material point method solving module, activate by entering the keyword 'TLmp'. Currently, only 'TLmp' can be used alone or in combination with 'sgmp', and cannot be used in combination with 'gimp' or 'bimp'.
4. Add a module to update particle volume using deformation gradient tensor, activate by entering the keyword 'UVFp'.
5. Add NeoHookean hyperelastic constitutive module, activate by entering 'neoh' in the material keyword, which will also activate the module that updates particle volume using deformation gradient tensor.
6. Add an external quasi-static loading module, activate this function by entering the keyword 'QuLo' and quasi-static loading time.
7. Add the external damping factor module required for quasi-static problems, enter the keyword 'Damp' and damping factor to activate this function.
